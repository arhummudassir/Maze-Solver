For this project there is a make file to compile and link the seperate files

If you have 'Make' installed on your computer then it is as simple as opening a powershell terminal in the project directory and 
typing the command 'make all' to compile and then './project' to run it

If you don't have Make installed on your computer then use the the following command : gcc memory.c ant.c interpreter.c main.c -o main.exe
To run type : ./main
